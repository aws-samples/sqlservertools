 Troubleshooting
1- Error  "Invoke-sqlcmd' command was found in the module  'SQLPs', but the module could not be loaded ...
   it means  the sqlserver PS module is not loaded into your system
    To install the PowerShell module for SQL server, first make sure you start PowerShell as admin.
    then run below command separately
      1-Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

      2-Install-module -Name sqlserver

      3-Import-Module sqlserver -DisableNameChecking;

    Once this is done you can verify that  sqlserver module has been successful by running blow  command 

    Get-Module -name sqlserver 
2- Invoke-sqlcmd : Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.SqlServer.BatchParser
   Try to run  the sript or the bat file as administrator 
3-Error Error
 invoke-sqlcmd : A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. - Provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The 
The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.)
in this Case Inovke-sqlcmd needs to run with this option -TrustServerCertificate
for example:
 $SQLStatus = Invoke-sqlcmd -serverInstance $dbserver -Database $DBName -query $sql -TrustServerCertificate

4- the specified module 'SQLSERVER' was not loaded  becuase no vaild module file was found in any module directory 
 you are getting this error  because sqlserve module is not  loaded, open a powershell as admin and run this command 
Install-Module -Name SqlServer -AllowClobber -Force
